## Description
This is a console application that takes information from the user and creates a README.md file for use in GitHub Repositories.  This application makes use of the Inquirer package that facilitates user input. The user input is a guided experience asking the user for information such as title of the repository, description, installation instructions, usage information, license, contribution guidelines, testing instructions and information on how to get in touch with the user should there be any questions.  With this information, the ReadmeGenerator constructs a README.md file with a License Badge at the top and a table of contents that links to the various sections.  

## Usage
Below is a link to a video of the walkthrough of the application:

Also, here is a link to the README.md file that was generated with the walkthrough video above: 


## Credits

This application had code already provided to me by the UNB Coding Bootcamp.  The index.js file was created by me and the inquirer was installed and used by me.
